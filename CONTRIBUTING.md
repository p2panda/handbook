## How to contribute to the protocol specification?

The p2panda [Handbook](https://github.com/p2panda/handbook) has a [`/specification`](/specification) folder containing the official protocol specification formatted as Markdown files. To contribute to the specification for any part of the protocol, the following process takes place:

**1. Jam Phase**
 * Post your idea for the protocol or p2panda in general as an GitHub Issue in the Handbook.
 * We use Issues to collect uncomplete ideas which need time, discussion and feedback. Some of them might never be part of the official specification but it can be nice to keep an idea somewhere for someone or something else. Issues can be discarded and don‚Äôt need to follow a strict form.
 * Each issue is assigned to an user which then serves as the *facilitator* of the idea, this person edits the Issue description, others can comment below the issue to discuss it and give feedback at any time.
 * Issues are tagged with one or many [labels](https://github.com/p2panda/handbook/labels). They help to roughly group Issues into common areas and will help to see what the ideas are around them.

**2. Specification Phase**
  * If your idea reaches maturity you can write it down more formally by adding a Markdown file inside the `specification` folder following our naming scheme and template you can see under [`/specification/TEMPLATE.md`](/specification/TEMPLATE.md).
  * Create a GitHub Pull Request (PR) with your contribution. PRs serve writing and reviewing the final specification.
  * Similar to Issues the assigned person of the PR is the only editor and facilitator, the work can be discussed within the PR comments section and PR reviews.
  * Move your PR from *Draft* into *Ready to be merged* status as soon as you're ready to receive feedback on it.

**3. Review and Merge Phase**
  * After all changes have been reflected and the p2panda [core team](/CODEOWNERS) approved the PR gets merged and the specification is official!

**4. Happy Phase!** üéÜ
