## How to contribute to the protocol specification?

The p2panda [Handbook](https://github.com/p2panda/handbook) has a [`/specification`](/specification) folder containing the official protocol specification formatted as Markdown files. To contribute to the specification for any part of the protocol, the following process takes place:

**1. Jam Phase**

- [Post your idea](https://github.com/p2panda/handbook/issues/new) for the protocol as a GitHub issue in this repository. You may use the format specified in [`/specification/TEMPLATE.md`](/specification/TEMPLATE.md) but you don't need to if that doesn't fit the idea at this stage.
- We use issues to collect uncomplete ideas that still need time, discussion and feedback. Some of them might never be part of the official specification but it can be nice to keep an idea somewhere for someone or something else. Issues can be discarded and don‚Äôt need to follow a strict form.
- Each issue is assigned to an user which then serves as the _facilitator_ of the idea, this person edits the issue description, others can comment below the issue to discuss it and give feedback at any time.
- Issues may be tagged with [labels](https://github.com/p2panda/handbook/labels). They help to get an overview of which ideas are out there for a given area of the p2panda project.

**2. Specification Phase**

- Once the facilitator feels that the idea has reached some maturity, they can write it down more formally by adding a Markdown file inside the `specification` folder. That file should follow the naming scheme and template specified in [`/specification/TEMPLATE.md`](/specification/TEMPLATE.md).
- Create a GitHub Pull Request (PR) with your contribution. PRs serve writing and reviewing the final specification.
- Similar to issues the person assigned to the PR is the _facilitator_, they edit the proposed specification and guide the process of developing the idea. Everyone may discuss the PR in the comments section.
- Move your PR from Draft into Ready to be merged status as soon as you're ready to move to the review and merge phase described below.

**3. Review and Merge Phase**

- The PR can be reviewed by anyone.
- The p2panda [project maintainers](/CODEOWNERS) approve the PR and merge it
- The specification is now part of the handbook!

**4. Happy Phase!** üéÜ

- the newly released specification is announced by the facilitator in the #p2panda channel in rocket.chat"
