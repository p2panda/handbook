Blobs require their own materialization logic and these system schemas allow a node to distinguish blob documents from other application data and behave accordingly. Conceptually, blobs can be considered to be \\"attachments\\" on other documents. It is not intended that blobs alone serve as a general purpose content delivery system. We expect blobs to be attached to other documents via relation fields, replication and materialization logic can be optimized based on this assumption.
