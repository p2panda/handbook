When you\'re querying over larger collections of data, you want to be able\nto get back smaller chunks at a time, and incrementally fetch the "next" batch. This is called\npagination, you get one page at a time, which contains a specified number of items. The\n',(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{children:"aquadoggo"})," API we're working with now implements cursor based pagination. Each item in your query\nresult can be identified by a cursor, and we can choose which cursor a queries results should\nstart after. This allows us to paginate over large query results from our application."]}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{className:"language-jsx",metastring:"live",live:!0,children:'function QueriesApp(props) {\n  const SCHEMA_ID =\n    \'vocabulary_0020840f74f3a3ca502c80b12ba54e5738c435d27e9c0717214a38173a3e31a75752\';\n\n  const queryBuilder = (after) => `\n    query {\n      all_${SCHEMA_ID}(\n        first: 10\n        ${after ? `after: "${after}",` : \'\'} \n      ) {\n        totalCount\n        hasNextPage\n        endCursor\n        documents {\n          fields {\n            word\n          }\n          meta {\n            documentId\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  `;\n\n  return (\n    <App header="\ud83d\udd0d \ud83d\udddf">\n      <PaginatedQuery queryBuilder={queryBuilder} endCursor=""></PaginatedQuery>\n    </App>\n  );\n}\n'})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.h2,{id:"the-end",children:"The End"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"We covered a lot there, well done making it to the end \ud83c\udf89!
