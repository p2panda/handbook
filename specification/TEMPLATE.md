# Your proposal's title

> Give this file a short name like `your-proposals-title.md`.

## Summary

> Summarise this specification in 1-2 paragraphs here.

## User stories

> Describe who is affected by your proposal and what changes they can expect by writing user stories about it. It can help to think about the questions: Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome?

## Documentation

> This section is a more formal description of the proposal, written as if it was a sub-section of the standard (for technical proposals) or a formal process or "fine print" for process proposals. It should be unambiguous and cover all known corner-cases. Formal language (such as protobuf schemas or binary header diagrams) are appropriate here.

## Rationale, alternatives and drawbacks

> Why is this design the best in the space of possible designs? What other designs have been considered and what is the rationale for not choosing them? What is the impact of not doing this? Why should we _not_ do this?
