# Your proposal's title

## Summary

> Insert 1-2 paragraphs of explanation of what this is about here.

## User stories

> Try to formulate the following questions as user stories: Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome?

## Documentation

> This section is a more formal description of the proposal, written as if it was a sub-section of the standard (for technical proposals) or a formal process or "fine print" for process proposals. It should be unambiguous and cover all known corner-cases. Formal language (such as protobuf schemas or binary header diagrams) are appropriate here.

## Rationale, alternatives and drawbacks

> Why is this design the best in the space of possible designs? What other designs have been considered and what is the rationale for not choosing them? What is the impact of not doing this? Why should we *not* do this?
