# p2:panda_face:

p2panda is a user-friendly peer-to-peer communications protocol for secure, energy-efficient, offline- and local-first web, mobile and desktop applications. We want this protocol to be a playful tool for people to hack, build, play, and experiment with.

Data changes in p2panda are signed, encrypted and published by clients using the [Bamboo](https://github.com/AljoschaMeyer/bamboo) append-only log data type which gets distributed over the network to other peers. p2panda allows for decentralised and federated network topologies or even hybrids of these and aims at running in web browsers without loosing its cryptographic features.

> **p2panda is currently very much in prototyping and specification phase, our milestones and progress can be seen below. If you're interested in any of these topics please get in touch!**

## Topics we're interested in

- **Browser friendliness**: Lightweight clients that can easily be implemented as websites.
- **Collaboration**: Data can be changed by multiple users at the same time with built-in CRDTs.
- **Decentralization**: Networks consist of both federated or decentralised nodes.
- **Deletion**: Data can be deleted without loosing verifiability and log integrity.
- **Encryption**: Transport communication is end-to-end encrypted via TLS 1.3, data is encrypted for groups via the Messaging Layer Security (MLS) protocol.
- **Energy efficiency**: Data- and energy-efficient storage and replication.
- **Fork proof**: Automatic detection of accidentially or maliciously forked append-only logs.
- **Identities**: A user account model that gives people options for managing one or multiple online identities across devices.
- **Integrity**: Authorship of all published data can be verified through signatures.
- **Local- & offline first**: Access to online services without reliable and performant internet infrastructure. Independence from the corporate cloud.
- **Low-power electronics**: Useable on low power devices.
- **Moderation**: Decentralised content moderation for users and groups.
- **Partial replication**: Nodes do not need to download the whole log to verify them.
- **Schemas**: User data is stored in published, versioned data schemas so data can be reliably accessed across services.
- **Warmth**: Computers make it easy to get carried away by their rigidly structured ways. However, every computer also contains an undeniable spark of pure chaos. We want to capture that spark to ignite a campfire for you to gather around and get cosy.

## Background

p2panda emerged out of activities around the self-curated zine [BLATT 3000](https://blatt3000.de) (2014) and subsequent festivals [VERANTWORTUNG 3000](https://blatt3000.de/verantwortung3000/) (2016) and [HOFFNUNG 3000](https://blatt3000.de/hoffnung3000/) (2017), the latter of these being the catalyst for building a custom platform designed to help communities organise in a decentralised manner, also called [HOFFNUNG 3000](https://hoffnung3000.de/).

While exploring building a p2p festival platform we met many people from the communities around Secure Scuttlebutt, DAT / Hypercore, Cabal, Chaos Computer Club, Fediverse, Antiuniversity Now, Pixelache trying to understand how this technology affects the way we organise ourselves.

This led to a group of people interested in realising a protocol for p2p communication, which ultimately should serve as a tool to build applications, like a festival tool and more. We've been meeting regularly on Mondays since 2019 to hack p2panda and have recently reached the point where we have a publicly running [demo project](https://p2panda.org/demo). We have also been active in some other projects including the [Liebe Chaos Verein](https://liebechaos.org/), organising a [p2p gathering](https://p2p-berlin.org/) and a reading group in Berlin. Obviously we're still going to organise another festival sometime :panda_face:.

## Overview

> **These libraries and applications are current work-in-progress reference implementations. See the Milestones below for current progress status.**

**Libraries**

- [`p2panda`](https://github.com/p2panda/p2panda): Provides tools to write a client for the p2panda network. It is shipped both as a Rust crate `p2panda-rs` with WebAssembly bindings and a NPM package `p2panda-js` with TypeScript definitions running in NodeJS or any modern web browser.

**Nodes**

- [`aquadoggo`](https://github.com/p2panda/aquadoggo): GraphQL node server for the p2panda network running as a standalone application or Rust `aquadoggo` crate.

**Clients**

- [`beep-boop`](https://github.com/p2panda/beep-boop): Chat client based on p2panda to experiment with. See it live under: https://p2panda.org/demo
- [`fishyfish`](https://github.com/p2panda/fishyfish): Command line interface to manage p2panda nodes.
