title: Publishing
---

- clients use two GraphQL operations for publishing entries:
  1. [`nextArgs`](#nextargs) query to retrieve parameters required for encoding an entry
  2. [`publish`](#publish) mutation to publish a signed and encoded entry together with its payload

## `nextArgs`

- returns parameters required for encoding new entries
  - implementations must not have side effects
- clients can't encode new entries without information from this endpoint because every entry needs to place itself in the first unused sequence number of a specific [_bamboo log_][bamboo] and also it needs to include the hashes of specific previous entries in its encoding
  - this information is held by the node
- clients may cache the arguments required for the next entry (they are also returned by `publish`)
- clients may also persist their entry logs locally to avoid any dependency for retrieving entry arguments of nodes at all
- clients must set the `viewId` input variable to receive arguments for encoding an `UPDATE` or `DELETE` operation.
  - clients must not set this when they want to encode a `CREATE` operation

```graphql
query nextArgs(
  """
  public key of the author signing and encoding the next entry
  """
  publicKey: PublicKey!

  """
  any view id from the document that will be updated or deleted with the next entry. leave empty to receive arguments for creating a new document.
  """
  viewId: ViewId
): NextArguments!
```

## `publish`

- if a `publish` request is accepted by a node it must publish the entry supplied with the request by taking the following steps:
  - the node must validate the received entry and operation by checking if:
    - the entry adheres to the [bamboo specification][bamboo] and has a valid signature and log integrity
    - the operation adheres to the [operation specification][operations]
    - the operation is linked to the entry with a correct payload hash and size
  - the node should persist the entry and operation and make it available to other nodes via [replication][replication]
  - the node may [materialise][reduction] the document this new operation belongs to, resulting in a new document view
- returns entry arguments required for publishing the next entry for the same document, similar to `nextArgs`
- returns an error
  - when the bamboo log, signature or document integrity could not be verified, the operation was malformed or schema not fullfilled
  - when the node is unable to persist the entry and operation at the moment

```graphql
mutation publish(
  """
  CBOR representation of a signed Bamboo entry, encoded as a hexadecimal string
  """
  entry: EncodedEntry!

  """
  CBOR representation of an p2panda operation, the payload of the Bamboo entry,
  encoded as a hexadecimal string
  """
  operation: EncodedOperation!
): NextArguments!
```

## Response

- both `publish` and `nextArgs` return the arguments for encoding and signing the next entry as a response

```graphql
type NextArguments {
	"""
	log id to be used to forge the next entry
	"""
	logId: LogId!

	"""
	sequence number to be used to forge the next entry
	"""
	seqNum: SeqNum!

	"""
	optional backlink hash to be used to forge the next entry
	"""
	backlink: EntryHash

	"""
	optional skiplink hash to be used to forge the next entry
	"""
	skiplink: EntryHash
}
