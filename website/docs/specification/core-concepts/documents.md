Documents are what we use to represent mutable data on the p2panda network. Authors can create, update and delete documents.

In the p2panda network, Documents are materialised on nodes and the resultant document views are made available for querying.

Documents are by default multi-writer. Write permissions can be derived from a relation to a key_group.

See the [documents] & [document views] sections in data types to read more.
