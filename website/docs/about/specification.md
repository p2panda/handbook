title: Specification
---

- the p2panda specification describes the protocol and the interfaces required to be implemented
- give a short overview of what is described in the specification using less formal language
- history
  - when did we start?
  - in what stages was the specification created?
  - what is the history of names in p2panda
- what is the future of this?
  - some parts of it can be extended in the future
  - could be helpful to restrict the future also, pointing at the principals of our design
