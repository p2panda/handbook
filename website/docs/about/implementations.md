- we have built p2panda-rs, a Rust implementation of the p2panda specification
- and we also publish p2panda-js, a library that allows you to use this from Javascript projects
  - describe in more detail the status of these implementations
  - add links, license information
- if you want to build your own implementation of p2panda, check out the next section, Specification
