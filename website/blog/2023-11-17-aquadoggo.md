title: aquadoggo 0.7.0
---

We just released aquadoggo `v0.7.0` which has been a solid year in the making. It has the longest changelog ever.

<!-- truncate -->

aquadoggo is a full p2p node implementation based on p2panda. It is a intended as a tool for making the design and build of local-first, collaborative p2p applications as simple as possible, and hopefully even a little fun!

Here are some highlights:

* Discovery of other nodes in local network and internet
* Peer-to-peer connections via UDP holepunching or via relays
* Replication of data efficiently with other nodes
* Filtered, sorted and paginated data queries via GraphQL
* Powerful configuration API for all sorts of needs
* Upload blobs and get them via HTTP

We took the opportunity to give the README some much deserved love:

.. and added pre-compiled binaries!
